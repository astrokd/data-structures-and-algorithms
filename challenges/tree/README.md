# Binary Tree and BST Implementation
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement Trees data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- [ ] - Create a Node class that has a left and a right
- [ ] - Create a BinaryTree class and define methods for each depth first traversals
  - [ ] - `preOrder`
  - [ ] - `inOrder`
  - [ ] - `postOrder`
- [ ] - Error handling
- [ ] - Test
  - [ ] - Instantiate empty tree
  - [ ] - Instantiate a tree with a single root node
  - [ ] - Add a left child and right child to a single root node
  - [ ] - return a collection of preorder traversal
  - [ ] - return a collection of inorder traversal
  - [ ] - return a collection of ipostorder traversal
- [ ] - Stretch Goal, k-ary-tree
