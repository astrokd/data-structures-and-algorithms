# Binary Tree and BST Implementation
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement Trees data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- [x] - Create a Node class that has a left and a right
- [x] - Create a BinaryTree class and define methods for each depth first traversals
  - [x] - `preOrder`
  - [x] - `inOrder`
  - [x] - `postOrder`
- [ ] - Error handling
- [x] - Test
  - [x] - Instantiate empty tree
  - [x] - Instantiate a tree with a single root node
  - [x] - Add a left child and right child to a single root node
  - [x] - return a collection of preorder traversal
  - [x] - return a collection of inorder traversal
  - [x] - return a collection of postorder traversal
- [ ] - Stretch Goal, breadth-first traversal
