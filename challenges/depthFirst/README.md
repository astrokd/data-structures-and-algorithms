# Graphs - Depth First
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

INPUT:
            (A)----(D)----(F)
              \   / | \   /
               (B)  |  (H)
              /    (E)
            (C)
              \
              (G)
OUTPUT:
 `A,B,C,G,D,E,H,F`
