# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a Linked List

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- [x] Create Node Class that has two properties, a value and pointer to the next Node.
- [x] In LinkedList Class have a head property and on instantiation create an empty linked list.
- [x]  Define a method called insert that takes a value and inserts it as the head with O(1) time performance
- [x]  Define a method called include which takes a value and returns a boolean of that values existance in the linked list
- [x]  Define a method called toString which returns a string of all the values in the string formated like; `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`
- [x] Write Tests
  - [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
  - [x] Can properly insert into the linked list
  - [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
  - [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
  - [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
  - [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
  - [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Following the class 


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

- insert
- includes
- toString
