# Stacks with Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a PseudoQueue class that uses the Stack class to enqueue and dequeue

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a PseudoQueue class. Utilize 2 Stack objects in your class to build the two methods

- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
