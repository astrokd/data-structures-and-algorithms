# Graphs
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement your own Graph

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

The graph should be represented as an adjacency list.

- [x] - AddNode()
- [x] - AddEdge()
- [x] - GetNodes()
- [x] - GetNeighbors()
- [x] - Size()
- [x] - Test
  - [x] - Node can be successfully added to the graph
  - [x] - An edge can be successfully added to the graph
  - [x] - A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
  - [x] - All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
  - [x] - Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
  - [x] - The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
  - [x] - A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
  - [x] - An empty graph properly returns null
